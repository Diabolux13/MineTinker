## Development
This repository is maintained by Flo56958 and mainly contributed by [Draycia](https://github.com/Draycia) and Flo56958. Everything is made in our free time and we are getting no money for making this plugin. It is mostly because we enjoy coding and having fun making this Plugin. The development of MineTinker is therefore as fast as we see fit and have the necessary time and motivation implement new features and fix bugs. The release schedule is not fixed and depends on the features and bugfixes planned for the next release which can vary greatly with further development.

## How to contribute to this repository:
MineTinker is in active development and we are constantly fixing bugs and adding new features. **Everyone is welcome to contribute to this plugin.**

There are several options for contributing:

- Making suggestions and creative ideas as a feature request with a GitHub-issue or on [Discord](discord.gg/ZEVNKhN)</br>
(An issue on GitHub is for us more easily to manage as it creates a new discussion and is therefore more organized than the discord channel)
- Reporting bugs via Issues on GitHub (or less preferably on Discord)
- Forking this repository and adding your own features and bug fixes (Feel free to send a pull request or get in touch with us if you have any questions or problems)</br>
**Note:** _Every pull request and code change will be carefully examinend and may not be accepted without further code change from our side or requests to the creator of the pull request_

## How to configure MineTinker on a server:
MineTinker has multiple config files, each containing other options and settings. 
The [main config](https://github.com/Flo56958/MineTinker/blob/alpha/core/src/main/resources/config.yml) contains the core settings for the plugin. Each modifier has its own config file saved in the 'Modifiers'-folder. These settings are unique to the modifier.

All config files (except the main one) are generated by Java code when the plugin is first run. Therefore, the repository does not contain those files directly. The explanation of these settings is next to the Java code for the specific option (for the [modifiers](https://github.com/Flo56958/MineTinker/tree/alpha/core/src/main/java/de/flo56958/MineTinker/Modifiers) this is in the reload()-method)
